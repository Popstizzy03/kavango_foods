        <p class="mb-4">
          Okavango Foods was founded with a passion for sharing authentic African flavors and culinary traditions. Our journey began with a simple goal: to create delicious food that brings people together.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Named after the Okavango Delta, one of Africa's most beautiful natural wonders, our food celebrates the rich diversity and vibrant tastes of African cuisine. We carefully select quality ingredients and prepare each dish with traditional methods and modern techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we're proud to serve our community with a variety of mouthwatering options, from our signature sausages to flavorful wraps and combo meals. We remain committed to our founding principles: authentic taste, quality ingredients, and food that you can truly enjoy.
